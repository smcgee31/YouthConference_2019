          The Stake will provide dinner on Wednesday evening and Saturday morning. All other meals
          will be assigned to a Ward or two to feed the whole camp, this way as a Ward you will only
          have to cook ONE meal and can use the Stake cooking stoves to do so.

        <Typography style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
          The Stake leaders will provide all the cooking equipment. There will be 3 camp stoves with
          3 propane tanks and a griddle. There will also be all the cooking implements, mixing bowls
          and paper products and some washing buckets for clean up.

          The camp does have approved fire rings and after counseling with President Buie it has
          been decided that due to the extreme dryness this year, as a group we will only have
          charcoal as campfires and that should be done with adult leader supervision at all times
          and a bucket of water nearby.

        <Typography style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
          Bring water containers and some water but there are water spigots at the campsite for us
          to use.

          As directed by the Church, this camp was planned by our young men and we as the Stake
          Young Men's Presidency are highly impressed with their desire for good wholesome
          activities including their desire for several spiritual activities.
